Handlebars highlighter for Brackets [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/karl-sjogren/brackets-handlebars-templates.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/karl-sjogren/brackets-handlebars-templates)
===============================

**This project has been abandoned since I don't use Brackets anymore. If you need something fixed in this plugin then fork it and fix it yourself.**

A syntax highlighting plugin for [Handlebars templates](http://handlebarsjs.com/) in the [Brackets editor](http://brackets.io/).

After installation you will get mixed syntax highlightning for html and handlebars in .hbs and .handlebars files.

**Note** Earlier versions of this plugin supported the .hbr extension as well since the original author used that back in the days. I haven't found any other references to it so it has been removed in a recent version. If you need this then please open up an issue or create a PR for it and we'll get it into the next release.

Installing
----------

The easiest way to install this extension is to use the [Extension Manager](github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Extensions) in Brackets.

If you want the cutting-edge version you can always clone this repo and manually install it into the brackets extension folder (you can find it in your system by going to Help > Show Extensions Folder in Brackets).
